					<p>This interactive map displays all Waste Sites, Mineral Extraction
Sites and Anglian Water sites in Suffolk. It is based on data from 2018,
so some information is not up to date (for example, Mason’s Landfill is
now operated by Valencia Waste Management Ltd, and not Viridor Waste
Disposal Ltd).</p>
<p>Hover over each site to get information on the name, operator and
type of sites. Individual sites can be searched for by clicking on the
lens icon. You can display this map full screen with the rectangle
icon.</p>
<p>In the bottom right, you can change the map background, and tick
different boxes to include/exclude different types of sites. <strong>The
Consultation Area is hidden by default</strong>, and can be switched on
here.</p>
<p>For Anglian Water Sites, the site boundaries were not available.
Therefore these sites are displayed as points only.</p>
<p>For some Mineral and Waste Extraction Sites, no site name and
operator is provided. This is a problem in the underlying data.</p>
